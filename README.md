This projects needs:

[ ] Github URL which contains
[ ] AI Model,
[ ] Input data and output results # no input data / output data- that's downloaded and created in R/T from json feed. but you do need to create a local divy shim to run , even though its cheap trash
[ ] UI (if any) and
[ ] a readme to run the code

### Overview

**prompts**
- how does this solution infuse AI
- novelty / creativity / uniqueness / prior art / new concept in the idea
- potential to be introduced into offerings (talk about how this is all cloud native)
- who will benefit from project (ds are a dime per 3 dozen anymore)
-
- architecture of the idea (show diagram)
- discuss divy dataset (real world raw data) but also how any dataset can be loaded from MQTT (and all of the schema inferences, etc)
- validating data set (schema inferences, opportunity for upgrades)
- uniqueness of approach, algorithm, methods.
- model selection process
- results- here actually talk about how you would train a model in R/T, describe how it is different than batch. and why it is important to look at R/T vs theoretical R/T
- analysis- what works, what doesnt, what to investigate futher
- **addresses an existing gap in ibm product** (x2 - no real time, no byo models)
- ^^ discuss streaming, tumbling windows vs sliding windows, event time, other flink bonus points (see "why-event-time-matter.png")
- how can solution be introduced into our offerings.
